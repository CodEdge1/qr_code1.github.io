## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

During project i was able to try on some codes on my own, linking my CSS and styling the page on my own is really awesome for me because during my learning process i always code along. Here are some codes i am proud of ....

```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css"> 
  <link rel="font" type="font"  href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">
```
```css
.container {
    width: 270px;
    height: 400px;
    align-items: center;
    justify-items: center;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);   
    margin: 150px auto 60px;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will would love to do more projects that will help me in my CSS styling develoopment in the future. as they say, "Practice makes Perfect".
